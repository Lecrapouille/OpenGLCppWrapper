version 0.8:

    Add unit tests and fix classes PendingData and Pending Container.
    Compute estimated GPU memory.
    Simplify code for VBO.
    Add more text in some exception when accessing to VBO when VAO and prog are not bound.
    Add mouse click event.
    Fix compilation warnings. Update Makefile.
    Add more examples. Minor updates.

version 0.7.1:

    Fix some errors found on Darwin architecture.

version 0.7:

    Hide vertex indices inside VAO: this avoids to application to hold it explicitely.
    VAO check its VBO sizes.
    GLProgram can draw VAO without passing number of vertices.
    Add first 3D primitives (tube and derivated).
    Update PendingContainer API.
    Export less C++ macros (ERROR, IMGUI).
    Fix some comments in examples.

version 0.6.1:

    Update Makefile.
    Fix compilation warnings.

version 0.6:

    Add first version of Framebuffer.
    Refactor examples.
    Make each header file be compilable by itself.
    Minor fixes.
    Update makefiles, install a pkg-config file.
    Add namespaces.

version 0.5:

    Add Texture3D and rename correctly class (TextureCube vs Texture3D)
    Update comments in code.
    Cleaning API (GLWindow, GLLocation and GLTexture inheritance).
    Make install the pkg-config file.

version 0.4:

    Add TextureCube.
    Update Makefiles (use git submodules).
    Fix compilations warnings.
    Classes are non copyable.
    Replace file extension .tpp by .hpp

version 0.3:

    GLProg can reserve number of elements when creating VBOs.
    GLProg can do more checks on VAO.
    GLProgram no longer store internally textures. VAO do it. This fix case where two VAO use the same texture of the same GLProgram.
    Make private some public methods.
    Add more draw() methods.
    Use GLSL 330 fin shaders.
    Remove useless files: Logger, File, Singleton.
    Split Maths file into several files.
    Add multi-texturing example.

version 0.2:

    Fix possible segfault when OpenGL context is not created.
    Fix segfault on GLProgram destructor when VAO is not bound.
    SceneGraph: Smart pointers and cleaning class.
    Change in public interfaces glenum by strong c++ type. This will help the developper to detect typage errors.
    PendingData: Replacing std::valarray by std::vector because it's not faster even for math operations.
    VBO: PendingData is no longer a member variable but inherit.
    Fix missing type() method for index buffer array (EBO).
    Adding an example of drawing VBO with indices.
    Reduce number #include.
    Replace std::exception with this library exceptions.

version 0.1:

    Basic but functional features.
