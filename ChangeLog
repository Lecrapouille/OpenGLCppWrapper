version 0.3:

    GLProg can reserve number of elements when creating VBOs.
    GLProg can do more checks on VAO.
    GLProgram no longer store internally textures. VAO do it. This fix case where two VAO use the same texture of the same GLProgram.
    Make private some public methods.
    Add more draw() methods.
    Use GLSL 330 fin shaders.
    Remove useless files: Logger, File, Singleton.
    Split Maths file into several files.
    Add multi-texturing example.

version 0.2:

    Fix possible segfault when OpenGL context is not created.
    Fix segfault on GLProgram destructor when VAO is not binded.
    SceneGraph: Smart pointers and cleaning class.
    Change in public interfaces glenum by strong c++ type. This will help the developper to detect typage errors.
    PendingData: Replacing std::valarray by std::vector because it's not faster even for math operations.
    VBO: PendingData is no longer a member variable but inherit.
    Fix missing type() method for index buffer array (EBO).
    Adding an example of drawing VBO with indices.
    Reduce number #include.
    Replace std::exception with this library exceptions.

version 0.1:

    Basic but functional features.
